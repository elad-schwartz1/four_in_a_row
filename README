==================
In this exercise I created a 4 in a Row game. The game consists of Game Logic, an AI component
a graphic user interface and a main function used to run the game. When a user opens the game they must first
select the player type for players 1 and 2 (either human or AI) and then the game begins with the players
selected, with each player attempting to place 4 consecutive disks in a row, and ends
either when a player has managed to do this or when the board is full and no more moves can be made. Once
the game is over the user will receive a pop up window where they are asked whether they would like to play again.
If they chose to play again then all settings are reset and the game may begin again, If they chose to exit then
the window shuts down and the program finishes.
